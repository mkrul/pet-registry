## New Learnings
- Gender field is now restricted to "Male" and "Female" options only
- Gender field can be left blank if unknown
- Gender values are case-normalized between frontend and backend
- Altered status uses numeric values (1/0/null) consistently throughout the application stack
- Altered status values are validated in both frontend and backend
- Altered status is handled consistently across services and seeds
- Seed data includes altered status for all reports
- Altered status values are normalized to handle empty/nil values consistently
- Altered status is displayed in human-readable format in view mode
- Form population correctly sets altered status radio selection
- Radio group values need consistent handling between null and empty string
- Altered status needs proper initialization in form state
- Form submission needs to include altered status field
- Altered status parameter needs to be permitted in controller
- Controller needs to handle both numeric and boolean string values for altered status
- Rails enum handles altered status conversion automatically
- Altered status normalization needs to handle numeric string conversion
- Altered status needs single consistent normalization
- Altered status normalization needs to preserve nil values
- Form field error displays should be consistent across all form components
- Error alerts should be positioned consistently below their respective fields
- Error display logic should be centralized in a reusable component
- Remove unused imports when centralizing component functionality to maintain clean code
- Ensure all components are cleaned up when centralizing shared functionality
- Form validation errors are more effective when displayed next to their respective fields
- Field-level error state should be managed at the form level
- Validation messages should be clear and contextual to their fields
- Material-UI RadioGroup treats undefined value as truly unselected, while empty string can be treated as a selectable value
- Form validation should include all required fields, including radio group selections
- Error messages for radio groups should follow the same pattern as other form fields
- Field-specific errors need to be properly passed to FormFieldError components
- Required field validation alerts should be consistent across all required form fields
- Validation error messages should follow consistent phrasing pattern across all required fields
- Altered status validation message should specifically mention spayed/neutered status
- Form validation should check altered status before species selection
- Form field errors should be passed specifically to their respective form fields for proper display
- Radio buttons should show error state styling consistent with other form inputs
- Radio button validation errors should only show error message without visual styling on the buttons
- Form validation logic should be separated from form components for better maintainability
- Validation error handling should be centralized to ensure consistent behavior
- DOM manipulation for validation feedback should be handled by validation service
- Form components should focus solely on form state and user interaction handling
- TypeScript interfaces should be updated when adding new error props to components
- Error state initialization should be centralized in validation service for consistency
- Location validation should be handled by validation service for consistency
- Validation services should import all required types directly
- Framework-specific types should be isolated in validation services
- DOM selectors should be typed for better maintainability
- Backend validation errors should be displayed inline with form fields for consistency
- Use "server" instead of "backend" in naming for clarity
- Use domain-specific naming for validation error handling
- Use consistent error display pattern (field alerts) instead of multiple systems
- Server validation errors should be mapped to specific form fields for proper display
- Form submission hooks should focus on data transformation, not error display
- Remove unused notification imports when switching to field-level alerts
- Form data transformation should be handled by a dedicated utility
- Form data utilities should import their required types directly
- Remove notification-related hooks when switching to field alerts
- Include all form fields in server validation error mapping
- Form field components need to handle their own error displays
- Maintain consistent input styling across form fields
- Backend validation errors should be handled consistently with frontend validation errors
- Form submission hooks should return proper response types for error handling
- Backend validation errors should trigger the same visual feedback as frontend validation
- RTK Query mutation responses need to be handled without unwrap() for proper error handling
- Backend validation errors need to be extracted from the RTK Query error response structure
- Error handling should preserve the original error structure for proper type checking
- MUI RadioGroup must maintain consistent controlled state throughout component lifecycle
- Radio button values should be normalized to strings for controlled components
- Form population should maintain consistent value types for radio inputs
- Error mapping needs detailed logging to trace validation flow
- Server error structure needs verification at each transformation step
- Form submission validation chain needs end-to-end tracking
- Backend validation messages can come in different formats (errors object vs message string)
- Error handling needs to handle both structured and simple message formats
- Error mapping should convert single message responses into field-specific format
- Backend validation messages need to be mapped to specific fields based on content
- Error field detection should use pattern matching for flexible message handling
- Single message validation errors need intelligent field mapping
- Error message objects should be passed through validation chain without premature field mapping
- Field mapping should happen at the validation service level for consistency
- Error scrolling should use the same field mapping as validation display
- Utility functions used across components need to be explicitly exported
- Field mapping utilities should be accessible to both validation and form components
- Error handling utilities should be part of the public validation API
