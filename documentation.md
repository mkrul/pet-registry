## New Learnings
- Consistent styling across shared components helps maintain UI uniformity between edit and create forms
- When sharing styles between components, it's important to include all style variations for MUI components (Select, Button, etc.) to maintain consistency
- Extracting shared styles to a common location helps maintain consistency and reduces duplication
- Adding MenuProps to Select components ensures consistent dropdown behavior across forms
- Consistent flex container spacing and layout structure helps maintain visual alignment between related components
- Using shared commonInputStyles across form components ensures visual consistency between edit and create forms
- Consistent MenuProps configuration helps maintain uniform dropdown behavior across the application
- Component styling consistency requires matching both the internal component styles and the wrapper/container styling
- Button styling consistency includes matching icon usage, text display, and layout spacing across similar action buttons
- Consistent image preview sizes help maintain visual harmony across different form views
- Using space-y-2 utility class provides consistent vertical spacing between form elements
- Label styling consistency is important for maintaining visual hierarchy across forms
- Maintaining consistent help text and user guidance across forms helps provide a uniform user experience
- Keeping imports clean and removing unused ones helps maintain code consistency across components
- Consistent styling for location selection components helps maintain visual harmony between create and edit forms
- Using MUI's sx prop with nested selectors allows for detailed styling control of Autocomplete and TextField components
- Maintaining consistent spacing and layout between location components helps create a unified user experience
- Ensuring consistent styling across related components (AddressSearch and LocationSelect) maintains visual coherence in the location selection feature
- Using shared style definitions like commonInputStyles helps maintain consistency even in nested components like AddressSearch
- Consistent label structure (using separate label elements instead of TextField labels) helps maintain visual hierarchy across form components
- Consistent dropdown height settings across all form components (including Autocomplete) improve visual uniformity
- Regular cleanup of unused imports helps maintain code cleanliness and reduces bundle size
- Extracting commonly used UI patterns like tips into reusable components helps maintain consistent styling and reduces duplication
- When migrating to shared components, it's important to remove duplicate fields to maintain a single source of truth
- Sharing form components between create and edit views ensures consistent user experience and reduces code duplication
- When sharing form components between edit and create forms, keeping the event handling consistent helps prevent type mismatches
- Direct handler passing is preferable to complex event transformations when the base event types are compatible
- SelectChangeEvent from MUI and React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement> can be used interchangeably for basic form handling
- When integrating shared components, maintaining consistent event handling patterns helps preserve existing functionality
- When integrating shared components, adapting event handlers to match existing patterns helps maintain backwards compatibility
- When integrating shared location components, maintaining consistent location data structure helps ensure compatibility
- Using shared location selection components helps maintain consistent geocoding behavior across the application
- Consistent location display formatting between create and edit views improves user experience
- Centralizing file reading logic in shared components reduces duplication and ensures consistent behavior
- When standardizing component interfaces, updating type definitions is crucial for maintaining type safety
- When modifying shared interfaces, making fields optional helps maintain backwards compatibility
- Consistent image preview handling between create and edit forms improves user experience
- Synthetic events should be avoided when direct handler passing is possible
- Complex synthetic events can be replaced with simpler event objects that match the expected interface
- Consistent event handling patterns improve code maintainability and readability
- When standardizing interfaces, all parameters should be used consistently across implementations
- Simplifying component usage improves code maintainability and reduces potential errors
- Event handler functions that don't depend on component state should be defined outside the component
- Using proper event creation methods improves type safety over simple type assertions
- Using optional chaining for event handlers improves type safety and prevents runtime errors
