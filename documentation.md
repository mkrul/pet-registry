## New Learnings

- Error notifications for login failures are handled through Redux state management
- The Notification component requires both the notification state and a way to clear notifications (onClose handler)
- After logout, users should be redirected to the login page to maintain proper authentication flow
- Success notifications should be shown for successful authentication actions with messages from the backend
- Notifications should be handled at the layout level to persist across route changes
- Success notifications for API actions should be handled in a single location to prevent duplicates
- Notifications should be centered and constrained within the page layout for consistent display

## Search Interface Updates
- Migrated to a unified search experience across all device sizes
- Replaced the separate desktop and mobile search interfaces with a single slide-out search panel
- Search panel is accessed via a floating action button in the bottom-right corner
- Panel slides in from the right side when activated
- Maintains all existing search and filter functionality
- Panel width is responsive: full-width on mobile, 1/3 width on larger devices
- Search bar consistently displays full-width above action buttons
- Filters display in a single column for improved readability
- Search button uses refined sizing for optimal visibility across screen sizes
- Added enhanced outward pulsing glow animation to search button on all devices that stops permanently after first click
- Prevents page scrolling and layout shifts when search panel is open
