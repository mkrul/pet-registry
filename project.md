## Learnings
- Simplified UI maintenance by unifying mobile and desktop search experiences
- Improved consistency in user experience across different device sizes
- Leveraged Framer Motion for smooth animations in the search panel
- Used Tailwind's responsive modifiers to create device-specific layouts
- Maintained consistent vertical layout improves usability across all screen sizes
- Single column layout for filters enhances scanability and reduces cognitive load
- Responsive sizing improves visual hierarchy on larger displays
- Progressive text scaling enhances readability across different screen sizes
- Custom Tailwind animations can enhance UI interactivity
- Conditional animation states improve user feedback
- Simplified animations can create more effective visual cues
- Component state can be used to track and respond to user interactions
- Managing document body overflow prevents unwanted layout shifts
- Consistent animations across devices improve UI predictability
- Subtle size adjustments can improve visual harmony
- Always visible filters reduce cognitive load by eliminating the need to show/hide interface elements
- Consistent prop usage across nested components ensures predictable behavior
- Proper credential handling ensures session persistence
- Selective user state clearing improves user experience
- API error handling should be specific to error types
- Skeleton loaders improve perceived performance during authentication checks
- Loading states prevent jarring UI transitions during state updates
- Preloading assets prevents unwanted visual transitions
