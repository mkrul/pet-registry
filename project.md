## Completed Tasks

### 2025-10-12: Disabled map interaction during report submission
- **Issue**: Users could interact with the map while a report was being submitted or while processing address data
- **Solution**: Updated `LocationSelect` to pass `readOnly={isDisabled}` to the `Map` component, which disables map clicks when `isLoading` or `isProcessingAddress` is true
- **Files Modified**:
  - `app/src/features/listings/components/common/LocationSelect.jsx`

### 2025-10-12: Changed grid layout to 4-column maximum
- **Issue**: The dashboard grids (Reports and Pets) displayed items 6-across on large screens, which was too wide
- **Solution**: Updated the `ItemGrid` component default className to limit the grid to a maximum of 4 columns (responsive: 2 on mobile, 3 on small screens, 4 on medium and larger)
- **Files Modified**:
  - `app/src/shared/components/common/ItemGrid.jsx`

### 2025-10-12: Fixed report detail view URL persistence
- **Issue**: When viewing a single report and performing a hard refresh, the page loaded back to the "My Reports" list view instead of staying on the report detail
- **Root Cause**: Clicking a report only updated local state without updating the URL with the `reportId` parameter, so hard refresh had no URL state to restore from
- **Solution**:
  - Added `handleSelectReport` to update both state and URL when selecting a report
  - Added `handleDeselectReport` to clear state and URL when going back
  - Updated all report selection/deselection points to use these handlers
  - Fixed the `reportId` useEffect to properly restore selected report from URL on page load
- **Files Modified**:
  - `app/src/features/dashboard/components/DashboardReports.jsx`

### 2025-10-12: Fixed report edit refresh issue
- **Issue**: After editing a report, the detail view showed stale data until hard refresh
- **Root Cause**: The `selectedReport` state contained a snapshot of the old report data and wasn't updated after the edit mutation completed
- **Solution**:
  - Modified `handleEditSaveSuccess` to accept the updated report data as a parameter
  - Updated `ReportEditView` to pass the mutation response to the success callback
  - Modified `useReportEdit` to transform and return the updated report data from the mutation response
  - The `selectedReport` state is now updated with fresh data immediately after save
- **Files Modified**:
  - `app/src/features/dashboard/components/DashboardReports.jsx`
  - `app/src/features/reports/forms/ReportEditView.jsx`
  - `app/src/shared/hooks/useReportEdit.js`

### 2025-10-12: Fixed report archive redirect behavior
- **Issue**: After archiving a report from the detail view, users remained on the archived report's detail page instead of being redirected to the main "My Reports" view
- **Solution**: Updated `handleConfirmArchive` in `DashboardReports.jsx` to clear `selectedReport` state and navigate to `/dashboard?section=reports` after successful archive
- **Files Modified**:
  - `app/src/features/dashboard/components/DashboardReports.jsx`
