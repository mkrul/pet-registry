## Technical Debt
- Add loading states for mode transitions
- Add proper error boundaries for form modes
- Add unit tests for useReportEdit hook
- Removed unused variant and sx props from BreedSearch
- Standardized form control styling
- Consider extracting common form field styling into shared constants
- Create shared constants for form input heights
- Consider creating a shared form field height configuration
- Consider standardizing size prop names across all form components
- Consider standardizing size values across all form components
- Add prop usage audit to component API changes
- Consider creating shared style constants for MUI compound components
- Consider extracting size constants for form field groups
- Consider creating a shared config for form field props by context
- Consider creating form context presets for common component configurations
- Create form field requirement documentation for all contexts
- Add field filtering utility for API requests
- Document which fields should be excluded from update requests
- Add type guards for form field serialization
- Add value normalization utilities for form submissions
- Add field name normalization utility for API submissions
- Document and centralize case conversion utilities
- Add tests for case conversion edge cases
- Add value type guards for form data processing

## New Learnings
- Using semantic HTML elements like h2 for titles improves accessibility and visual hierarchy
- Removing redundant labels can make the UI cleaner and more intuitive
- When using size props, ensure consistent values are used across all instances of a component to maintain UI consistency
- Consistent punctuation in labels helps improve readability and visual hierarchy
- Maintain consistent label styling between view and edit modes for better user experience
- Use loading indicators for asynchronous content like images to improve user experience
- Handle both loading and error states for image components
- When receiving handler functions as props, avoid redefining them locally to prevent naming conflicts
- When combining local state with prop callbacks, ensure both are properly handled in event handlers
- Use consistent disabled state styling (opacity and cursor) across all interactive elements
- Apply disabled state styling to all action buttons during form submission to prevent multiple submissions
- Always verify map component properly uses provided coordinates
- Include visual markers for locations on maps
- Maintain consistent map zoom levels across different view states of the same data
- When renaming props/variables, ensure to update all usage locations to maintain consistent behavior
- When renaming props, ensure to update both component usage and type definitions
- When components have default prop values, ensure they match the expected defaults across all usage contexts
- Consider different default states for components based on their usage context
- Reuse location display components consistently across different views of the same data
